# Blackjack

## Summary

This is a python project implementing the card game of Blackjack. The following program has a main file `blackjack.py` and three classes `Player.py`, `Dealer.py` and `Hand.py`. The Hand class is a superclass, and the classes Player and Dealer inherit from the Hand class. 

The program reads two text files `instructions.txt` and `cards.txt`. The `instruction.txt` file contains a long list of instructions for new players to the game of Blackjack. The `cards.txt` file contains all 52 cards of the deck. 

This program demonstrates understanding of inheritance, object orientated programming, and reading input in Python.
