HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK
- You are dealt two cards face up. The delear is also dealt 
  two cards, one face up and one face down.
- The value of the cards two through ten is their numerical value
  and face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten.
- Aces can worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of 
  the card values. You are allowed to draw additional cards(hit)
  to improve your hand. 
- Once you have completed your hand, It is the dealer's turn. 
  The dealer reveals the hidden card and must hit until the 
  cards total up to at least 17 points. 
- You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. 
  The hand with the points closest to but not exceeding 21 wins. 
- The detailed outcome of the hand follows:
  - If the player is dealt as Ace and a ten-value card, and 
    the dealer is not, the player wins and receives 150% of 
    their bet.
  - If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"); the player 
    loses even if the dealer also exceeds 21.
  - If the dealer busts and the player does not, the player wins.
  - If the player attains a higher sum than the dealer and does
    not bust, the player wins.
  - If the player and the dealer receive a blackjack or any other
    hands with the same sum, it is called a "push" and no one 
    wins.
